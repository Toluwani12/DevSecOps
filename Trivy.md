# Trivy
Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner designed for container images. It's specifically focused on identifying security vulnerabilities in containerized applications. Here are the key aspects of Trivy:

1. Container Image Security:
* Trivy scans container images for known vulnerabilities, providing a report of any security issues it finds.

2. Fast and Lightweight:
* Trivy is optimized for speed and resource efficiency, making it suitable for use in CI/CD pipelines and container orchestration platforms.

3. Support for Multiple Package Managers:
* It supports various package managers used in different programming languages, including APT, Yum, Apk, and npm. This means it can scan images built with different technologies.

4. Database of Vulnerabilities:
* Trivy uses a comprehensive database of known vulnerabilities sourced from various security databases, including the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

5. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:
* It can be integrated into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows to automatically scan container images as they are built.

6. Output Formats:
* Trivy provides scan results in various formats, including JSON, HTML, and simple text, making it easy to integrate into different toolchains.

7. Layer-wise Scanning:
* Trivy performs scans on each layer of a container image. This enables it to identify vulnerabilities specific to individual layers, providing more granular information.

8. Severity Levels:
* Trivy classifies vulnerabilities into different severity levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) to help prioritize remediation efforts.

9. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) Identification:
* It provides details about specific CVEs, including their descriptions, affected versions, and links to additional information.

10. Policy Enforcement:
* Trivy allows you to set policies for what constitutes an acceptable level of risk. This can help automate decisions about whether to allow an image to proceed in the deployment pipeline.

11. Non-Intrusive Scanning:
* Trivy does not alter or modify the container images it scans, ensuring that the integrity of the images is preserved.
In summary, Trivy is a valuable tool for securing containerized applications by detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities in container images. Its speed, ease of integration, and comprehensive vulnerability database make it a popular choice for
